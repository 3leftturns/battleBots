#Build Photos

This directory contains photos from the various stages of design and build and shows additional details about key elements in the design process.

I would like to give some special credit to Landon Limb. At any point I became blocked in the design/build of the Lego chassis, he had a way of putting two or 3 elements together in an elegant solution. This would fuel my creativity and allow me to create simplistic and effective designs. This particularly was helpful during the motor box design.
