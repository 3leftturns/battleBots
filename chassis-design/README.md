##Build Notes:

Not all Lego elements used in the project were available for visualization in Lego Digital Designer. Appropriate substitutions are noted:

* Each tank model was made from 2 sets of 42032 Technic Compact Tracked Loader. 
* In addition, 4 3648 24-tooth gears are needed. 2 of them are in the Tracked Loader set. Gear assortments are widely available on Amazon and Ebay.
* The plan drawing does not show the tank tread wrapped around the wheel assemblies due to limitations in the software.
* All 4 3x3 1/2 width right angle brackets in the drawing are actually 3x3 1/2 width curved brackets as supplied in the Compact Loader sets.

*I have attempted to make the colors match the set but the software does not allow all colors.*

The RED 1 width cross axle couplings on each of the drive wheel axles need special attention. (The drive axles have the 24T gears on them)
You will need to epoxy your servo horn to the coupling on both sides.

I have attempted 3D printing of these components but could not yet refine a design to work with Lego and 9g Servo. TODO: Once complete, upload the files here.

Coupling Kragle Instructions:
I found it most effective to use JB Quik Weld (6 Minute JB Weld). 
* Since the coupling has small slits that could seep epoxy, cover them with a small strip of duct tape.
* Place a small cross axle that you don't care about in the coupling and then dry fit the servo horn to the coupling and axle. 
* Push the coupling down to flush with the servo horn. The axle helps center the assembly. 
* Mix up a small amount of JB Quick Weld and place the assembled plastic parts into a vise. 
* CAREFULLY apply a small amount of epoxy around the horn and coupling, taking care not to epoxy over the axle.
* Let dry and remove the axle. Cut off the servo horn wings and sand smooth - JB Weld is machinable when dry.
* Once sanded, cover each end with small duct tape squares and apply liberal amounts of JB Quik Weld to the edges of the cylinder. Don't run off. After about a half hour it should still be tacky like putty. Remove from vise, take off the duct tape with a hobby knife and form the epoxy putty into the final shape. Let dry overnight.
* You will need 2 couplings per model.

The motor box in the center front undercarraige of the chassis fits 2 9g micro servos. I tried modifying cheap 180 degree servos into 360 degree servos, with very frustrating results.
I recommend purchasing 360 degree micro servos over modifying them. They lay on their sides, horns outward and flipped to the front. The cables exit the front and feed to the back under the turret box and under the main circuit board.

The turret box in the top center holds a 180 degree 9g micro servo. Zip tie the turret boom to a long winged servo horn. Double stick tape down the servo.

The LED in the turret boom is a IR LED that has been sanded lightly to fit in a Lego Technic hole. To avoid breaking off the legs of the led, cut the legs to about 1 cm long and put them in a hobby knife holder. Then turn the LED in the holder in 400 grit sandpaper checking often for fit. Solder 2 small gauge braided wire to the LED and add a female .01 header connector.

All non-Lego components secure with either zip ties, friction or temporary double sticky tape. An early objective of this project was not to use Kragle on the Lego. With the exception of a few couplings, that is the case.
